Fellow ZBG users, 



To leverage bug bounty to improve the security of ZBG, we are excited to announce the launch of a special bonus program that multiplies payouts for consecutive vulnerabilities
reports between 2019/10/23 1:00 AM (UTC) and 2020/01/23 1:00AM (UTC). Through the bonus, we will also grant up to 5,000 USD as additional rewards to the top-performing security 
researchers reporting through the Bugcrowd platform. 



We look forward to continuing our work with researchers who help us identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities within the ZBG system. And to encourage participation, 
we are offering bonuses for multiple reports made through the program for one month, including:



50% bonus for two consecutive valid reports
75% bonus for three consecutive valid reports
100% bonus for four or more consecutive valid reports. 
In addition, we will reward the top three researchers ranked by bounty amounts for valid reports during the duration of the bonus period. Here are the prizes for the top 
participants:


First prize: 5,000 USD in ZT + exclusive ZBG hoodie
Second prize: 2,500 USD in ZT + exclusive ZBG hoodie
Third prize: 1,000 USD in ZT + exclusive ZBG hoodie
Please submit reports at:  vip@zbg.com



Please read the ZBG Security Bug Bounty Program for details, documentation and vulnerability classifications, before submitting a report.



Terms:



ZBG reserves the right to cancel or amend the bounty or bounty rules at our sole discretion.

Rewards will be issued within 2 weeks after the vulnerability report is verified. You will be able to login and see your prize via Distribution History > Account Center.

Rewards will be paid out in ZT. ZBG may award an additional reward bonus for exceptional reports at our discretion.

ZBG will only reward the first verified report of a vulnerability; similar reports that are submitted will not be rewarded.

Thanks for your support!
